## A word from Citizen Health

We are working at Citizen Health on several advanced Health and Healthcare related projects in order to create a better Health Operating System for our future. If you have ever wanted to be a part of a community that builds helpful solutions for yourself and everyone; you have found your tribe!

This community is built differently. In addition to just coding and building, we want to far extend what we do here in this space. We want ideas, from everyone! This will be a unique and dynamic place to not only code and design, but create. We want suggestions from everyone: designers, coders, artists, social workers, marketers, patients, caregivers, salespeople, physicians, health professionals, authors, video producers, project managers, gamersâ€¦. YOU.

Why? It will take a committed and dedicated group of citizens to bring the best ideas and solutions to healthcare. We need you, your best ideas, your activism and your voice.

Citizen Health is your Community of Health. Welcome!
